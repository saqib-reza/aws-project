## 🧪 Lab Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Create IAM users (instead of using the root account).  
- Assign **policies using the principle of least privilege**.  
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for stronger security.  
- Test permissions and verify access control.

## 🖥 Steps Covered
1. Log in as Root User (only once).  
2. Create an **Admin IAM User**.  
3. Create a **Developer User** with limited access.  
4. Apply **Least Privilege Policy** (JSON example included).  
5. Enable **MFA** on critical accounts.  
6. Test access and permissions.  
7. Optional cleanup.

## 📸 Suggested Screenshots
- IAM Dashboard (users created).  
- Policy JSON editor with least privilege policy.  
- MFA setup screen (blur sensitive info).  
- Test results (access denied for restricted user, success for allowed actions).

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Explore IAM roles across multiple AWS accounts.  
- Automate IAM setup using **Terraform or CloudFormation**.  
- Integrate IAM with AWS Organizations for enterprise-scale security.
